Panopto-Java-BlockBooker
========================

A simple command line tool to take a series of schedules in a csv file and book them all in one go using the API

The code requires the [Panopto-Java-Util](https://github.com/andmar8/Panopto-Java-Util) Library

How to use the jar
------------------

<pre>
java -jar PanoptoBlockBooker.jar Server Username Password .csv-file
</pre>

For example...

<pre>
java -jar PanoptoBlockBooker.jar panoptoserver.example.com admin password sessions.csv
</pre>

Format of the CSV
-----------------

To use the block booker you need to specify a CSV file in the following format...

<table>
<tr>
	<th>name</th>
	<th>folderExternalId</th>
	<th>start</th>
	<th>end</th>
	<th>location</th>
	<th>externalId</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>COM1001/L01</td>
	<td>Q1213-COM1001</td>
	<td>02/10/2012 13:00</td>
	<td>02/10/2012 14:00</td>
	<td>BLDG.1.10</td>
	<td>#SPLUS123456</td>
</tr>
<table>

Or, as it would be in the csv....

<pre>
"name","folderExternalId","start","end","location","externalId"
"COM1001/L01","Q1213-COM1001","02/10/2012 13:00","02/10/2012 14:00","BLDG.1.10","#SPLUS123456"
</pre>

* The name can be anything you like, just make sure to escape double quotes and commas
* The start and end MUST be in DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm
* You need to be using external Id's for the folder and location or the block booker will not be able to work out which folder to assign the recording to or which remote recorders to use
* See the [Booking Engine](https://github.com/andmar8/Panopto-PHP-Booking-Engine) for more about external Id's
